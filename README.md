### 🚀 Tips:
- Replace placeholder names like `YOUR_USERNAME`, `YOUR_REPO_NAME`, and your email.
- Add badges (GitHub stars, license, deployment status) if you want to polish it more.

Want a version with **GitHub Actions CI/CD**, **MongoDB Atlas setup**, or **Vercel/Render deploy guide** included? I can add those too.
